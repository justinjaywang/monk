Scholars of the middle class, when they have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it. Scholars of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh greatly at it. If it were not thus laughed at, it would not be fit to be <em>the Tao</em>.</p><p>Therefore the sentence-makers have thus expressed themselves:</p><blockquote><p><em>The Tao</em>, when brightest seen, seems light to lack;<br>Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back;<br>Its even way is like a rugged track.<br>Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise;<br>Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes;<br>And he has most whose lot the least supplies.<br>Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low;<br>Its solid truth seems change to undergo;<br>Its largest square doth yet no corner show<br>A vessel great, it is the slowest made;<br>Loud is its sound, but never word it said;<br>A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.</p></blockquote><p><em>The Tao</em> is hidden, and has no name; but it is <em>the Tao</em> which is skillful at imparting to all things what they need and making them complete.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/monk/tag/scholars/">scholars</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/monk/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-6","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
